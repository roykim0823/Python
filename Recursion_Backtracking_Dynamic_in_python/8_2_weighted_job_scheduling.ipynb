    "## Recursive Version\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First sort jobs according to finish time.\n",
    "2. Now apply following recursive process. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "   // Here arr[] is array of n jobs\n",
    "   findMaximumProfit(arr[], n)\n",
    "   {\n",
    "     a) if (n == 1) return arr[0];\n",
    "     b) Return the maximum of following two profits.\n",
    "         (i) Maximum profit by excluding current job, i.e., \n",
    "             findMaximumProfit(arr, n-1)\n",
    "         (ii) Maximum profit by including the current job            \n",
    "   }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "How to find the profit including current job?\n",
    "The idea is to find the latest job before the current job (in \n",
    "sorted array) that doesn't conflict with current job 'arr[n-1]'. \n",
    "Once we find such a job, we recur for all jobs till that job and\n",
    "add profit of current job to result.\n",
    "In the above example, \"job 1\" is the latest non-conflicting\n",
    "for \"job 4\" and \"job 2\" is the latest non-conflicting for \"job 3\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The following solution may contain many overlapping subproblems. For example, if lastNonConflicting() always returns the previous job, then findMaxProfitRec(arr, n-1) is called twice and the time complexity becomes O(n*2n). As another example when lastNonConflicting() returns previous to the previous job, there are two recursive calls, for n-2 and n-1. In this example case, recursion becomes the same as Fibonacci Numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "So this problem has both properties of Dynamic Programming, Optimal Substructure, and Overlapping Subproblems. \n",
    "Like other Dynamic Programming Problems, we can solve this problem by making a table that stores solutions of subproblems."
